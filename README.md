# Classifying Lung Sounds for Respiratory Disorders via Mel-Spectrogram Analysis Using Custom CNN

This project introduces a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify lung sounds associated with various respiratory disorders. The core idea is to convert lung sound audio recordings into **Mel-spectrograms**â€”2D image representations of audio dataâ€”and use CNN-based image classification techniques for accurate disease detection.

## ðŸ©º Project Overview

- **Goal**: Classify different types of respiratory diseases using lung sound recordings.
- **Method**: Transform audio signals into Mel-spectrograms and use a custom-designed CNN for classification.
